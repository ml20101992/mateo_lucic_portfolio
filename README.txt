These code examples will hopefully present my knowledge of PHP, HTML+CSS, MySQL, JavaScript and NodeJS.

Short example synopsis
Example 1:
Group task was to create a multi page website on the topic of our choosing. While I cant take credit for CSS styling
I can take credit for doing the entire PHP for the project.

Example 2: 
Individual task was to create a multi paged website using modern web design principles, while using PHP for whatever we think will
improvee the page. This whole work was done solely by me.

Example 3:
Thought exercise in NodeJS. The idea was to make an authorization/authentication element of a server, and to test it. There were some ideas
of incorporating it further in a project I was working on, but they did not bear fruit.

Example 5:
Group task was to create a simple diet manager in Java while cramming in as much design patterns as we could.
My work consists of creating controllers, models, creating basic view framework and implementing daily overview in addition
to tying everything together.
