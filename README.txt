These code examples will hopefully present my knowledge of PHP, HTML+CSS, MySQL, JavaScript and NodeJS.

Short example synopsis
Example 1:
Group task was to create a multi page website on the topic of our choosing. While I cant take credit for CSS styling
I can take credit for doing the entire PHP for the project.

Example 2: 
Individual task was to create a multi paged website using modern web design principles, while using PHP for whatever we think will
improvee the page. This whole work was done solely by me.

Example 3:
Thought exercise in NodeJS. The idea was to make an authorization/authentication element of a server, and to test it. There were some ideas
of incorporating it further in a project I was working on, but they did not bear fruit.
