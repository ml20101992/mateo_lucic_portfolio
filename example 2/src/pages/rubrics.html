        <h2>Content</h2>
        <p>
            The content has been fleshed out in order to fix my mistakes from the first project.
            My personal grade 18/20
        </p><br>

        <h2>Navigation</h2>
        <p>
        In my personal opinion, the navigation is well done and is styled well. I have completely reworked it
            and fixed some errors that cropped out in the first version.<br>
        My personal grade: 20/20
        </p><br>

        <h2>Content Organization</h2>
        <p>
                In my personal opinion, organisation is clean and concise both in structure and in presentation.
            No changes from the first attempt except delineating sections more clearly/<br>
                My personal grade: 20/20
        </p><br>

        <h2>Design</h2>
        <p>
                Rebuilt from the ground up with lessons learned from group final project. Added hero messages to every page<br>
                More fluid design and the content is more streamlined.<br>

        </p><br>

        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <p>
                Having in mind that this was what I was struggling the most with, I believe that this is flawless<br>
