                After water, coffee is the second most popular drink in the world.
                Since many people drink the hot beverage, it is natural that people will drink it at work as well.<br><br>
                The morning coffee is for people trying to wake and get some energy to start the day. Some people drink more
                than one coffee throughout the work day to keep their energy level up.<br><br>
                The hot beverage is also used during business meetings to keep them focused on the topic but most
                often people drink coffee to have coffee breaks which end up turning into social conversations.<br><br>
                These coffee breaks can sometimes lead to a negative rumour spreading in the office, but can also be good for the work
                environment where the stress level is low and a possibility of a good new idea for the company.<br><br><br><br>
                And remember... Coffee is love, Coffee is life!
